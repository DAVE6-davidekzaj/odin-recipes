                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Activate the yeast: In a small bowl, mix the yeast with 2 tablespoons of lukewarm water. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. </li>
                    <li>Combine dry ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, combine the bread flour and salt.</li>
                    <li>Make the dough: Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and pour in the activated yeast mixture along with the rest of the lukewarm water. Using a wooden spoon or your hands, mix until a dough forms.</li>
                    <li>Knead the dough: Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and knead it for about 10-15 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. You can also use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment for this step.</li>
                    <li>First rise: Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for about 1-2 hours, or until it doubles in size.</li>
                </ol>
